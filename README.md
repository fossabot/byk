A simple book manager.

## Usage

### Run API Server

**Please make sure to run API server in async mode.**  
The dev server (`django manage.py runserver`) is already integrated with async support with Daphne.  

For production environment, you can use any kind of ASGI server, e.g., Daphne, Uvicorn, Hypercorn, etc.  
For example, using Hypercorn:
```bash
hypercorn byk.asgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

You are strongly recommended to use `byk.settings_env` for production, or you can create your own settings module based
on it.  
Please make sure to configure database and run migrations prior to exposing the service to public.
```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=byk.settings_env  # or your custom settings module
python byk-server/manage.py migrate
```


### Run Task Worker

```bash
faststream run byk.task_broker.app:faststream_app
```
